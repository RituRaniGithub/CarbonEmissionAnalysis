# About this project

## Data Cleaning:

The Data obtained was cleaned and required no cleaning.

## Data Preparation:

I pulled the data in Power BI, Replacing null values in the "Emissions" Column with Zero. Connected the tables Carbon Gas Emissions and Normalizing factor by "Fiscal Year" as I wanted to analyze the Market capitalization and Revenue trends present in the "normalizing_factors" Table along with Emissions present in the "Carbon Gas Emissions " Table.

## Analysis:

I then proceeded to make new measures to calculate the Emissions Reduction, Revenue, and Market capital growth along with the increase in employee numbers from the year 2015 -2022.

Made a line chart between the Fiscal Year and Emissions to look at the trend, Which came out to be a decreasing trend and the forecasted trend line confirmed that Apple might reach its goal by 2020.

While there was a reduction in carbon emissions, The market capitalization and Revenue saw appreciable growth.

It's remarkable how the company realized its product's carbon emissions and tried to reduce its carbon footprint. Apple did reduce both corporate and product life cycle emissions by the year 2022 but it still needs to focus on product carbon footprints.

It was all about Apple's Carbon Emissions Reduction Analysis,
